<title><![CDATA[Switching from Ghost to Hexo]]></title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>My blog used to use <a href="http://hyde.github.io/" target="_blank">Hyde</a>, a python clone of the popular jekyll platform. When <a href="http://ghost.org" target="_blank">Ghost</a> came out, I quickly switched over, due in main part to the great editor and beautiful themes. I used <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster" target="_blank">buster</a> to serialize the blog so that I could still serve it as a static site. I had two main regrets, though. 1) using buster to scrape ghost was a hack. 2) My posts were locked in an sqlite db, where git could only do a binary diff.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I <a href="/2014/07/26/switching-from-ghost-to-hexo/">recently switched</a> from <a href="http://ghost.org" target="_blank">ghost</a> to <a href="http://hexo.io" target="_blank">hexo</a>, and the biggest thing missing for me was the editor interface. So I made one. Currently, it&#39;s mostly a clone of the Ghost interface, but I have some ideas for making it even more awesome.</p>
