<![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve expressed <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredforsyth/status/507253337310236672" target="_blank">multiple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredforsyth/status/668947788021960704" target="_blank">times</a> that I really want to get into clojurescript, but I keep running into barriers.</p>
<p>My background: I&#39;m an experienced JS dev, and for my personal projects I use the latest &amp; greatest of <a href="https://facebook.github.com/react" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://flowtype.org" target="_blank">Flow</a>, <a href="https://babeljs.io" target="_blank">Babel</a>, and <a href="https://webpack.github.io" target="_blank">Webpack</a>, which makes for a pretty rocking experience. Given my background, lots of my hesitation could just be the fact that staying in my comfort zone of javascript is <em>easy</em>, though it may be far less <em>simple</em> than the experience provided by clojurescript.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, I hope I will have convinced myself to face my fears and dive into clojurescript anyway :D</p>
