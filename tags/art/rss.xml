<![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I made a cellular automata simulator in Go, inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4cV0nCIZoc">this video</a> about a “rock, paper, scissors” simulation, where there are three “species” of cells which consume each other. <!-- Here's [a post about that](). --></p>

In short, you draw walls/mirrors with your mouse, and it ray-traces light from a central source. Very beautiful and “zen”. However, as a programmer, drawing lines by hand was far too inaccurate. So I forked it and added a scriptable interface for adding walls.</p>
