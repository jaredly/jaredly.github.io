<title><![CDATA[Making a cross-platform mobile game in Reason/OCaml]]></title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>I launched the first cross-platform mobile native game written in Reason a few weeks ago 🎉, to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jaredforsyth.gravitron" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gravitron-master-gravity/id1330043938" target="_blank">iOS app stores</a>, with a free <a href="https://gravitron.jaredforsyth.com" target="_blank">web version</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/jaredly/gravitron/releases/tag/1.0.0" target="_blank">macos desktop bundle</a> (source code <a href="https://github.com/jaredly/gravitron" target="_blank">all on github</a>).</p>
<p>Getting there required lots of fiddling with cross-compilers and build systems, and so I made a tool that will take away much of the pain involved, so you can get started immediately and get your game into the world. <strong>NB: This is still super experimental</strong> but I&#39;m really excited about it and want to get y&#39;all in on the fun.</p>
