<![CDATA[Deploying Native Reason/OCaml with Zeit's now.sh]]>
 
</title>
<description>
 
<![CDATA[<p>I’m working on a new ReasonReact project that will need a stateful server, and I thought it might be nice to write that in Reason too :) but what’s the best way to deploy it? And by “best” I mean “easiest, with a free-to-try option”. After looking around a little, I settled on Zeit’s <a href="http://now.sh">now.sh</a>.</p>
<p>What did I end up with? <strong>A 10mb docker image</strong> with a server inside!</p>
