<p><strong>Validated versioning</strong>: making the contract between library author and consumer explicit and statically verifiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- make unannounced breaking changes unrepresentable -->
<p>Upgrading libraries is both (a) an annoying chore, and (b) has high uncertainty about how “safe” it is to do.
We rely on semantic versioning to signpost when a library undergoes a “breaking change”, but this is far from reliable.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the issues around versioning &amp; dependency management come down to the fact that <strong>the contract between library author and consumer is currently “stringly typed”</strong>: we rely on documentation, readmes, and changelogs (none of which can be statically validated) to indicate versioning guarantees. We can do better.</p>
