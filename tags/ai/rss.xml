<![CDATA[A Practical Comparison of AI Coding Agents]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I wanted to make a web site, but I didn’t want to do the work. It’s not a very interesting website, technically speaking, so it would be tedious to implement. Also, corporate wants me to jump into the Beautiful World of Tomorrow, and all that ent<em>ai</em>ls.</p>
<p>I have free access to VSCode + Copilot because of my open source work, so I started into it with GPT 4.1, because it’s free. After some initial scaffolding, I got to a point where I wanted a second opinion (because it was obviously missing some things), and I figured I’d do a little comparison of the models available to me.</p>
