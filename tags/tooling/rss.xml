<![CDATA[Detecting unused styles in JavaScript with `babel-traverse`]]>
 
</title>
<description>
 
<![CDATA[<p>Last week, my coworker <a href="https://twitter.com/crm416">Charlie</a> asked what it would take to automatically detect and purge unused <a href="https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite">aphrodite</a> styles in our codebase.</p>
<p>If asked 2 years ago, I probably would have gone with a regex and a string-munging python script, but I’d just spent the past few nights messing with babel plugins, and figured I could probably get pretty far with relatively little work. As it happened, I was <strong>impressed by how easy it was</strong> using the tools that babel provides.</p>
<p>As a bonus, it also works with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native</a> because they have the same API, and it could probably be extended to other libraries without too much work.</p>
