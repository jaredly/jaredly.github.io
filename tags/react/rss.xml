<![CDATA[Advanced ReasonReact: Higher Order Components]]>
 
</title>
<description>
 
<![CDATA[<p>After jumping into ReasonReact, I soon came to the question “How do I do higher-order components?” I had some duplicated logic in several components regarding data fetching, and I wanted to use this familiar React tool to refactor.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we’ll be making a “fetches something from the network” wrapper component. We’ll start with a “mixed component” that we’ll then try to refactor.</p>

<![CDATA[A ReasonReact Tutorial]]>
 
</title>
<description>
 
<![CDATA[
<p>Are you a big fan of React, and want to know more about Reason/OCaml? I made this for you!</p>

<blockquote><p>This tutorial was updated on April 20, 2019 for reason-react version 0.7.0, and React hooks! If you want to see what it was like before hooks, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190420064733/https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/a-reason-react-tutorial/">here's the previous version</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/reason/">Reason</a> is a project that adds a JavaScript-style syntax and a bunch of conventions and tooling to OCaml. The goal is to make this awesome language, with its powerful type system and robust multi-platform compiler, accessible to a broader audience. It's backed by the good folks at Facebook who invented and built React, and so naturally having best-in-class React interop has been a high priority.</p>

<p>This tutorial aims to give you a nice introduction to the syntax and type system of Reason, through the <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/">ReasonReact library</a>. We'll be building a simple Todo list application.</p>

<![CDATA[Visualizing Reactive Streams: Hot and Cold Observables]]>
 
</title>
<description>
 
<![CDATA[<p>Reactive Programming is getting a lot of attention these days, and it promises to reduce frustration, bugs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, there’s a sizeable learning curve involved while you try and get your head to think in streams instead of imperative sequential processes.</p>

So I made one. Currently, it’s mostly a clone of the Ghost interface, but I have some ideas for making it even more awesome.</p>
